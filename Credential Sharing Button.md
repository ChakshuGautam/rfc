## RFC: Share Button for Verifiable Credentials in a PWA

### Summary
This RFC proposes the implementation of a Share Button in a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to share Verifiable Credentials using the Credential Handler API (CHAPI) and additional sharing mechanisms, such as QR codes, PDFs, and JWTs.

### Background
Verifiable Credentials are a standardized format for expressing digital credentials that can be cryptographically verified. The Credential Handler API (CHAPI) enables web applications to request, store, and manage credentials through a standardized browser API. This RFC aims to simplify the process of sharing Verifiable Credentials through a user-friendly interface in a PWA using CHAPI and other sharing mechanisms.

### Motivation
The current process of sharing Verifiable Credentials can be cumbersome and may involve multiple steps or manual copying of data. By implementing a Share Button in a PWA with support for CHAPI and additional sharing methods, users can easily and securely share their credentials with minimal effort, improving the user experience and encouraging wider adoption of Verifiable Credentials.

### Goals
1. Implement a user-friendly Share Button that is easily accessible in the PWA interface.
2. Integrate CHAPI to request, store, and manage Verifiable Credentials within the PWA.
3. Ensure the integrity and authenticity of shared Verifiable Credentials.
4. Allow users to select the specific credentials they wish to share and the recipient or service to share with.
5. Provide support for various sharing methods, including CHAPI, QR codes, PDFs, and JWTs.

### Non-Goals
1. Modifying the existing Verifiable Credential format or underlying cryptographic processes.
2. Implementing additional features or functionalities beyond the Share Button and supported sharing mechanisms.

### Proposed Solution
1. Design and implement a Share Button in the PWA interface, allowing users to access it with ease.
2. Integrate CHAPI as described in the provided documentation to request, store, and manage Verifiable Credentials within the PWA.
    - Import the CHAPI Polyfill and relevant libraries.
    - Register the wallet as a Credential Handler and configure the app's manifest.json.
    - Set up listeners for CHAPI events, such as get() and store() events.
    - Implement functionality to handle Get Credentials Events and Store Credentials Events.
    - (Optional) Integrate DID Authentication with CHAPI.
3. When the Share Button is clicked, prompt the user to select the credentials they wish to share and the recipient or service they want to share them with.
4. Utilize existing cryptographic standards and libraries to ensure the integrity and authenticity of shared Verifiable Credentials.
5. Support multiple sharing methods, including CHAPI, QR codes, PDFs, and JWTs.
6. Provide clear instructions and feedback to users throughout the sharing process.

### Security Considerations
1. Ensure that only the intended recipient or service can access the shared Verifiable Credentials.
2. Implement strong encryption methods to protect the credentials during transmission.
3. Employ proper access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized access to the user's credentials.
4. Regularly review and update the cryptographic libraries used to stay current with best practices.

### Open Issues
1. Compatibility with various platforms and devices.
2. The trade-off between ease of use and security.
3. Integration with existing identity and access management systems.

### Alternatives Considered
1. A standalone application for sharing Verifiable Credentials instead of integrating it into the PWA.
2. Using third-party sharing services or platforms.

### Future Work
1. Explore additional sharing mechanisms and formats to support a wider range of use cases.
2. Investigate integration with other identity frameworks and protocols for a more seamless user experience.
3. Evaluate user feedback to identify areas for improvement and potential new features.
4. Monitor advancements in cryptographic standards and security best practices to maintain the security and integrity of shared Verifiable Credentials.
5. Enhance usability and accessibility by implementing responsive design and support for various platforms and devices.

### Conclusion
By implementing a Share Button in a PWA that leverages CHAPI and additional sharing mechanisms like QR codes, PDFs, and JWTs, users can easily and securely share their Verifiable Credentials. This streamlined process improves the user experience and encourages the adoption of Verifiable Credentials as a secure, decentralized method of managing digital identities. Regular updates and ongoing development will ensure that the proposed solution remains secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
